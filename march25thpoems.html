            1. <br>
            “There! In the pink hat.That’s our guy.” The twins looked up from their porcelain espresso cups <br>
             at a car that had just pulled up. <br>
            Two seats down, under the same linoleum ceiling <br>
            the same cloud of listerine- scented air, <br>
             A party of five didn’t talk about any of it. <br>
            In uniform, they kept ankles tight and knees at the angle their profession preferred they be at. <br>
            Slowly, a few would point their gaze at the others’ wrists. <br>
            Desperately trying to locate a sense of neutrality. <br>
            One of them dabs at the sweat that insists on making an appearance at the hair-line. Not <br>
             knowing, but knowing how to pitch this idea he’s had brewing for a bit.<br>
            “What’s ego-death all about?” <br>
            <br>
            Toes sixteen-inches in the sand,that’s where her mind was. The <br>
            other person at the table. One <br>
            of the people at this table. She noticed the person across from her at the table zoning out to the <br>
            silver-ware in between them.<br>
            At Least two out of three in this party were experiencing that quiet asphyxiation that occurs<br>
            when feelings are so strong and so tied up in their biome (it becomes a biome).<br>
            <br>
            Wanting to blurt out, “IDON’TTHINKI’M OK-NONEOF THISISOK,”<br>
            She instead manages a: “Did anyone order a side of hash browns by chance?”<br>
            <br>
            2.<br>
            De-pathologize <br>
            De-pathologizing<br>
            <br>
            I’m not broke, you’re not bad<br>
            I don’t owe you anything<br>
            And you’re paying rent just like the rest of us<br>
            <br>
            The mantra worked. Is it <br>
            supposed to be this---- malleable?<br>
            <br>
            I don’t know yet, but we’re finding <br>
            out. Taking away the “1,2,3”, the <br>
            finger-tapping,<br>
            To find out.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            I don’t want to be anyone’s doctor. <br>
            don’t want to pathologize you.<br>
            I like it when you tell me what happened in the shower that time your roommates were at work.<br>
             I like looking in the mirror at the “audacity” of how far my belly extends towards the sink<br>
            and remembering all the tenderness I hold.<br>
             I like that my knees get sore when I walk too far up the hills.<br>
             <br>
            There’s space,<br>
            enough of it for one less body to be riddled with knots and undeserved tightness.<br>
            <br>
            I like that you present as fixated<br>
            but, give it a day or two<br>
            And you’re just like those bumblebees.<br>
            <br>
            The ones that become biology’s “cult-queen”<br>
            The ones that are loyal first and foremost to the blueberry. <br>
            I like that I'm allowed to be here.<br>
            <br>
            <i>They’re called Southern blueberry bees.</i>
